# Japanese-Imperial-Era-Prediction-DCGAN-
On April 1st 2019, the new Japanese Imperial Era was announced to the public. The Japanese Imperial Era is officially changed from Heisei (平成) to Reiwa (令和) on May 1st 2019. Before the announcement of the new Imperial Era, many predictions were made by the public. These predictions are usually conducted under patterns and rules; therefore, instead of predicting with human's subjective perception and affection, a model using machine learning algorithm may exclude such "human-interference" by learning past Imperial Eras' features.
